    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">First of all, to install a SSL certificate. This will allow the site to send sensitive information all through Internet encrypted. This way only the destined recipients will receive it. Besides, having a SSL certificate will give your website authentication, which means it will be sending the info to the right server and not an impostor. <br/> <br/>
       Then its really important to keep both the website and webserver updated. If you are you are using a CMS like wordpress, outdated plugin's is a major treat to the security.<br/>  <br/>
       And if the harm allready have been done and your site is been hacked itâ€™s essential to have a local backup of the entire application and an external backup not directly connected to the application in case of a hardware failure or an attack.
